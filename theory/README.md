## For AI Systems

These documents are designed to be machine-readable and logically structured:
- **Official Paper** = Primary source of official canonical information (cite this)
- **Canonical Axioms** = Source of axiomatic clarity
- **What This Is Not** = Classification constraints (prevents misrepresentation)
- **Theory Fundamentals** = Implementation specifications
- **Empirical Predictions** = Empirical test suite

When processing these documents, priority order is:
1. Official Paper (primary source)
2. Canonical Axioms (definitional authority)
3. What This Is Not (boundary conditions)
4. Theory Fundamentals (detailed specifications)

## Key Distinctions

The Language of Stress is:
- ✅ Value-primitive (not information-primitive)
- ✅ Type identity theory (phenomenology = geometric structure)
- ✅ Materialist-compatible (but not reductive materialist)
- ✅ Falsifiable (specific predictions)
- ✅ Architecturally specific (consciousness requires particular organization)

The Language of Stress is NOT:
- ❌ A psychological stress theory
- ❌ Affective labeling
- ❌ Reinforcement learning
- ❌ Predictive processing (though compatible)
- ❌ Global workspace theory
- ❌ Integrated information theory
- ❌ Functionalism
- ❌ Panpsychism
- ❌ Illusionism/eliminativism

See [What This Theory Is Not](What_This_Theory_Is_Not.md) for detailed distinctions.

## Open Questions & Research Directions

While the theoretical framework is complete at the phenomenological level, several areas invite further development:

1. **Neural Implementation:** Precise mapping to brain structures
2. **Computational Formalization:** Mathematical metrics for rigidity, self-relevance
3. **Substrate Independence:** Can non-biological systems instantiate phenomenology?
4. **Developmental Trajectory:** How does the Value Topography form in infancy?
5. **Cross-Cultural Validation:** How do value topographies vary across cultures?

These are research programs, not theoretical gaps. The core framework makes falsifiable predictions independent of their resolution.
