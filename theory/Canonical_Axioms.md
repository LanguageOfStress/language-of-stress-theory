# The Language of Stress
## Canonical Axioms (v1.0)

---

## Axiom 1 — Consciousness Is Value-Bearing

Conscious experience is fundamentally normative: every conscious state is experienced as mattering to the organism to some degree.

**Consciousness is not neutral information processing; it is intrinsically evaluative.**

---

## Axiom 2 — Valenced Tension Dynamics Are the Primitive Currency of Experience

The basic units of subjective experience are topographical distortions created by valenced tension dynamics (tension, stress, relief). These dynamics constitute the brain's only direct epistemic access to value: things that relieve tension are substantiated as 'good'; things that increase tension are substantiated as 'bad.' This is not learned association but the primitive mechanism through which brains validate truth from within the 'black box' of subjective experience.

---

## Axiom 3 — The Phenomenological Field Is a Value Topography

At any moment, conscious experience consists of a constantly fluctuating, unified landscape of value gradients, termed a **Value Topography**, composed of many simultaneous valenced tension dynamics.

The phenomenological "field" of consciousness is the configuration of gradients on this unified value topography, not a collection of discrete representations.

---

## Axiom 4 — The Archetype of Self Organizes the Value Topography

The Value Topography is hierarchically organized around the **Archetype of Self**—the most defended, most rigorously maintained, and most information-dense structure. Distortions are weighted by self-relevance: deviations threatening or validating the Self create disproportionate topographical impact. Other conscious entities can be architecturally integrated into one's Self-model, such that their states directly create distortions within one's own topography (the mechanism of empathy and altruism).

---

## Axiom 5 - Constructed Distortion

In conscious experience, phenomenological urgency and prioritization ("distortion") do not arise directly from deviation or arousal alone. Distortion emerges only through the interaction of deviation from expected archetypes, the rigidity with which those expectations are held, the interpreted meaning of the deviation, and its degree of self-relevance.

**Distortion ∝ deviation × rigidity × interpretation × self-relevance**

As a consequence, tension, stress, and distortion are dissociable states, and may vary independently under different conditions.

---

## Axiom 6 — Attention Follows Value Gradients

Attention is guided by the magnitude, rigidity, instability, and self-relevance of topographical distortions within the value topography.

What becomes salient in consciousness is determined by priority and normative significance, not informational richness or global availability alone.

---

## Axiom 7 — Unity of Consciousness Arises from Coherent Valuation

The unity of conscious experience arises from the integration of value gradients into a single, dynamically coherent value topography organized around the Archetype of Self. Unity is maintained even as contents vary because attention follows the largest distortions relative to the current topographical state, determined by deviation magnitude, archetype rigidity, and self-relevance.

---

## Axiom 8 — Emotional Qualia Are Geometric Patterns of Tension Dynamics

Emotions correspond to distinct geometric patterns within the value topography, characterized by specific relationships among tension magnitude, distribution, rigidity, and resolution trajectories. Emotional "feel" is the distinctive pattern of topographical warping or resolution within experiential space.

These patterns are algorithmic—characterized by specific geometric relationships that are substrate-independent in principle. Whether non-biological substrates can instantiate the phenomenal aspect of these patterns remains an open empirical question, though biological systems achieve this through hormonal and neurotransmitter feedback mechanisms that substantiate the geometric distortions.

---

## Axiom 9 — Cognitive Content Is Modulated by Value

Concepts, thoughts, perceptions, and memories enter consciousness insofar as they are embedded within or modulated by valenced tension dynamics.

**Cognition without value remains unconscious or background processing.**

---

## Axiom 10 — Altered States Correspond to Altered Value Geometry

Altered states of consciousness (e.g., meditation, flow, psychedelics, dissociation) correspond to systematic transformations in the geometry of the value topography, including changes in gradient magnitude, distribution, coherence, and archetypal rigidity.

---

## Axiom 11 — Phenomenological Quality Is Identical to Valuative Structure

The qualitative character ("what it is like") of experience is identical to the structure of valenced tension dynamics—that is, the configuration of topographical distortions within the value topography—not an emergent property layered atop physical processes.

**There is no additional phenomenal substance beyond valuation structure.**

---

## Axiom 12 — Consciousness Is a Language of Priority

Consciousness functions as an internal language of priority through which the organism encodes, negotiates, and resolves competing values across time.

**Subjective experience is how priority is expressed, not how information is displayed.**

---

## Clarifying Commitments (Canonical, Non-Axiomatic)

- The Language of Stress is **value-primitive**, not information-primitive.

- **"Normative"** refers to value-bearing significance for the organism—states that register as better or worse, more or less urgent, independent of explicit deliberation or moral judgment.

- **Stress** is defined normatively, not colloquially or as mere psychological strain.

- The theory is **materialist-compatible**, but does not reduce phenomenology to computation alone.

- LoS is distinct from affective labeling theories, reinforcement learning, predictive processing, Integrated Information Theory, and Global Workspace Theory, though it may coexist with or constrain them.

- **"The Archetype of Self** is not a homunculus or central processor—it is a defended structure within the topography that organizes value gradients hierarchically through self-relevance weighting."

- **"Architectural integration of other Selves** (empathy mechanism) is not simulation or Theory of Mind—it is literal partial merging of self-models within one's Value Topography."

- **"Rigidity** is not stubbornness or inflexibility—it is the defensive intensity with which archetypes are held, determining sensitivity to deviations."

- **"The theory predicts consciousness requires specific architecture**, not merely high complexity, information integration, or global broadcasting."

## Falsification Criteria

The Language of Stress theory is falsifiable through the following predictions:

1. **If self-relevant weak signals do NOT reliably capture attention over non-self-relevant strong signals, the theory is falsified.**

2. **If self-model fragmentation does NOT fragment consciousness (controlling for neural integration), the theory is falsified.**

3. **If consciousness is observed in systems lacking unified value assessment mechanisms, the theory is falsified.**

4. **If rigidity scores do NOT predict mental health pathology severity better than symptom counts, the theory is falsified.**

These predictions distinguish LoS from competing theories and provide clear experimental targets.

## Status

This document constitutes the **canonical axiomatic formulation (v1.0)** of the Language of Stress theory of consciousness. All extensions, applications, empirical predictions, and comparisons should be interpreted as deriving from these commitments.
