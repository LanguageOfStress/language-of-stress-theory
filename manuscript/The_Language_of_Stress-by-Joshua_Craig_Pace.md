## Preface

The following work is not intended as a specialized deep dive into the minutiae of cognitive science, neurobiology, or psychology. Instead, it is a high-level architectural exploration of the brain's phenomenology: an attempt to map the mechanism by which physical matter generates subjective phenomenal experience and consciousness.

I am not an academic. I do not hold a chair at a university, nor am I affiliated with a corporate laboratory. I am an independent researcher, and I am aware that my lack of formal credentials and the non-traditional style of my writing will be immediately apparent to the expert reader. To those who have spent their careers in the rigors of peer-reviewed journals, I ask for a brief suspension of the compulsion to dismiss this work based on its lack of academic polish.

I have spent a decade stress-testing the logic of this framework. My goal in these pages is to cover vast conceptual ground—spanning from the arithmetic of stress to the geometry of identity—without becoming paralyzed by granularity. Volumes could be written on any single chapter provided here; however, I have chosen to be descriptive enough to convey the fundamental principles of the "Language of Stress" while moving quickly enough to reveal the total architecture.

I ask the reader—especially those who are experts in their specific fields—to follow this discussion without the weight of preconceived notions. Please suspend any initial impulse to reject these arguments due to deficiencies in my vocabulary or communication. If, at the end of this journey, you find flaws in the foundational premises or the internal logic, I genuinely welcome your feedback and challenges.

But I offer this one caution: do not confuse a lack of formal credentials with a lack of understanding. While I may be an outsider to the institution, I have lived with this "Hard Problem" as my singular focus for the last ten years. In the realm of consciousness—a phenomenon that currently lacks a consensus materialist explanation—we are all, in a sense, beginners. For who can claim definitive expertise in a phenomenon they cannot yet explain?

What I offer here is a compelling, falsifiable, and implementable answer to the most enduring mystery of our species. I invite you to look past the messenger and evaluate the map–to decide for yourself if this framework has the explanatory power to finally and definitively put us over the target.

## Introduction

You—the human reader—have never directly perceived or experienced raw objective reality. For your entire sentient life, you've been submerged and surrounded by a thick lens of subjective and valenced appraisals derived from your unique life experience. This comprehensive mapping of appraisals is your **Value Topography** and it functions as an abstract omnipresent "heat map" that distills the levels of goodness and badness, rightness and wrongness, love and hate, friend and foe, significant and mundane of everything you perceive. It filters all of your senses, frames all of your thoughts, and is the context for all your experiences, emotions, and beliefs. In short, it is the scaffold for your entire understanding of your internal and external worlds.

### Value and The Prioritizing Brain

At its most foundational level, your brain is a sophisticated prioritization engine. It prioritizes time, resources, actions, outcomes, focus and attention in order to maximize your chances to survive and thrive. However, this ability to prioritize would be impossible without an intrinsic mechanism for subjectively assessing value. Your brain must be able to qualitatively determine the nuanced levels of "goodness" or "badness" of elements within its environment. Without this ability, your perception would be flat as everything would seem equally significant-–leaving you aimless or apathetic to your surroundings.

### Valenced Tension Dynamics - The Language of Stress

Tension dynamics (the interplay of tension, stress and relief) are fundamental to how the brain works—and the influence of these dynamics extend far beyond mere homeostatic or allostatic functions. Valenced tension dynamics are a universal language of all brains that we refer to as the **Language of Stress**. Tension, stress, and relief provide the context for all subjective evaluations. In the simplest of terms, things that increase stress are considered "bad" by your brain, and things that relieve stress are considered "good". Although it may seem, at first, like an over-simplification, this principle underpins your entire subjective experience. The Language of Stress is so nuanced and so comprehensive that it defines and contextualizes all of your values, your emotions, your intuitions, your experiences—everything you value, everything you believe, everything you love, everything you feel, everything you pursue, is all ultimately derived from your life-long histories with tension, stress, and relief.

Let's illustrate this with an example:

> Imagine a newborn that has just been delivered. Imagine the stresses being registered in her little brain. Prior to this moment, everything she understood of the world was limited to the confined space within the womb. Now, however, her understanding has been abruptly and forcefully redefined. Suddenly, she's experiencing a world that is colder, louder, brighter, and chaotic. Of course, there's not much she can do about it. Her little brain might instinctively experiment with any action it can manage to effect–she might blink, cry, contort, and so on–but she has no real remedies for these stresses. She's just going to have to adjust to this new reality.
>
> Suddenly, she finds herself being wrapped securely in a warm blanket. Of course, this newborn has no cognitive understanding of what a "blanket" is. What does register, however, is that the sharp stings of cold are being muted and that the secure feeling of the blanket seems comfortingly familiar. Her stresses are being relieved.
>
> In that moment, her little brain discovers one of its first subjective "truths" about this new world: that blankets are "good." This isn't an opinion–she didn't mull it over and make a logical assessment. Rather, the goodness of blankets is simply a "truth" of the universe that has been substantiated by the relief she has just experienced.
>
> In a very short time, she will discover other "truths" that will have a profound influence on what she values, how she feels, and how she interprets the world. She will soon discover that the goodness of Mom is perhaps the most unassailable fact of her universe, as she will be the single greatest reliever of this young child's stresses for many years to come. The child will quickly associate her mother's presence with good outcomes, and her absence with bad outcomes. When Mom isn't there, the child will experience stress, and when Mom returns, she will experience relief.
>
> Through the valenced tension dynamics of tension, stress and relief, the child's brain quickly develops a vast mental topography of these subjectively discovered "truths." While these "truths" will change and adapt through growth and experience, the Topography itself will be a permanent fixture through her entire life and will lend a sense of permanence to her perception of self and her identity.

### Motivation and Attention

The Language of Stress isn't just a tool for assessing valence and value, it is also essential for guiding attention and motivating actions. There are countless dimensions of life and experience that could claim our attention at any given moment. The nuanced dynamics of tension, stress, and relief allow us to quickly assess what may be our most immediate needs or our most important long-term goals, and motivate us to prioritize actions accordingly to find relief.

### Intrinsic Morality

What is the nature of morality? Where does it come from? What makes an action right or wrong? These are questions that philosophers have grappled with for thousands of years. However, this "mystery" appears to ignore what is right in front of us. That life requires morality. It is a core feature of brains. All brains, in order to prioritize, must have a means to discern goodness and badness–to discern good actions from bad actions, good outcomes from bad outcomes–and the Language of Stress is that universal means. The arithmetic of morality is the arithmetic of stress and relief. Actions and actors that increase stress are bad, actions and actors that relieve stress are good. While cultures have varied significantly regarding which stresses and whose stresses are important to remedy, the underlying principle is always the same.

### Language of Stress and Digital Consciousness

This document presents both a theory of Mind and consciousness as well as an architecture by which the Language of Stress can be theoretically implemented in digital brains–endowing them with the ability to recursively measure valenced tension dynamics across infinite dimensions of experience, to subjectively develop their own Value Topographies, and to have the means and motivation to prioritize attention and actions–thereby adapting, reacting, learning, and finding meaning within dynamic environments. In addition, this architecture will theoretically enable a digital entity to experience authentic emotion, beliefs, intuition, creativity, moral reasoning, dreams, and even consciousness.

## 01 Value Topographies

**Mappings of our subjective understanding**

Value Topographies are vast subjective world models shaped from our life-long recursive relationship with tension, stress and relief. They are hyperdimensional value mappings of the general and situational levels of goodness or badness of everything in our internal and external worlds. These topographies are the primary subjective lens by which all of our perception is contextualized and understood. This lens is always active–it frames everything we see, touch, taste, smell, and hear. It is the basis of everything we know, the context of everything we feel, and the framing of everything we think.

If we want to understand consciousness, we must first understand how the brain constructs and utilizes these Value Topographies. We must understand the mechanism–the language–by which the brain assesses value, determines priorities, and motivates action. We must understand the Language of Stress.

### Value's Intrinsic Valence

Value, in the Language of Stress, is the measure and degree of the subjective goodness or badness of everything around us. Something is good if it relieves stress, and bad if it increases stress. In other words, (and this cannot be emphasized enough) value is phenomenal–it feels like something to the brain. It is also inherently valenced; stress feels bad, relief feels good. The greater the stress, the greater the brain's conviction that the source of the stress is bad (is wrong, immoral, ugly, threatening, etc). This conviction instinctively compels us to hate, loathe, reject, distrust, fight, avoid. On the other hand, the greater the relief, the greater the brain's conviction that the source of the relief is good (is right, moral, just, beautiful, friendly, etc)–compelling us to love, cherish, admire, desire, trust, and seek out.

### Value is Truth to the Brain

These tension-driven assessments of "goodness" or "badness" are not opinions to our brain, they are deeply-substantiated subjective truths. When we feel admiration for someone, what we are feeling is our brain's conviction of their goodness. When we know something is morally right, we feel our brain's conviction of its inherent rightness. When we are excited for a particular outcome, it is because of our brain's conviction of the goodness of that outcome.

Our brain's conviction in its appraisals of every outcome, action, object, person, thought or idea, forms a rigid scaffold–a Value Topography–that frames our entire understanding of everything around us.

### Truth, Plasticity and Tension

As important as it is for a Value Topography to be rigid, it must also be adaptive. It must be capable of dynamically adjusting to ever-changing circumstances and new information. It is this plasticity that enables learning, growth, wisdom, intelligence, perspective, empathy, moral reasoning, introspection, intuition, and other related characteristics and abilities.

Tension arises from the interplay between the rigidity required to make sense of the world and the plasticity required for navigating dynamic environments. It is this tension–the difference between what we know via our judgements and expectations, and the positive or negative deviations we experience in a dynamic world–that feels like something to the brain. These are the valenced tension dynamics that are the basis of our phenomenal consciousness.

## 02 Concepts

**Nested Densities of Information and Value**

The common definition of a concept is "an abstract idea" or a "general notion". However, for the purposes of our discussion, we will discuss concepts as rich and nuanced tapestries—full of dense information and subjective value. Every concept represents a configuration of features, attributes, values, action potentials, and so on. In other words, concepts are compositions of other concepts. Consider the image below. Each larger circle represents a concept that is composed of a dense collection of smaller circles that also represent concepts, and if you were to expand on the smaller circles, you would find more dense collections of concepts ad infinitum.

Consider the concept of a dog. When you read the word "dog" a generalized, high-level notion, image or essence might enter your mind. However, when you zoom in, you start to see that it is really a dense galaxy—an endless cascade—of constituent concepts, data, value, emotion, experience, abstraction. There are roughly 350 dog breeds in the world. Each breed has distinctive physical, temperamental, behavioral attributes. Each individual dog has its own personalities, quirks, histories, physiology, biome, DNA. The effect is the same if you zoom out. The concept of dog can be a constituent part of countless other concepts (e.g. family, fostering, rescue, grooming, hunting, policing, cartoons, comics, literature, movies, biology, zoology, evolution, psychology, service, etc).

In addition, layered into all this dense information is your own personal history with dogs. Your concept of a dog is loaded with countless subjective experiences, good or bad. If you're a dog lover, you've had many positive experiences with them and you look forward to interacting with them. Your concept of dog likely emphasizes positive attributes like friendliness, cuteness, loyalty, or play--while minimizing attributes like aggression, anxiety, or territorial behaviors. If you own a dog, you likely have a profound emotional connection to it and your concept of dog is loaded with those emotions. On the other hand, if you're afraid of dogs, or you find them messy, destructive, or overly aggressive, your concept of dog would give greater weight to those attributes while minimizing any positive attributes.

### The Subjective Nature of Concepts

We often think of concepts in objective or categorical terms, however, this masks the reality that they are deeply subjective. If you refer back to the image of the nested circles, no two people will view the same concept through the same subjective lens. Each individual will have differing perceptions, compositions, evaluations, and prioritizations of the same concept—as well as for each of the underlying concepts it is composed of. Two people discussing the same concept will have very different information densities and values and will attach varying levels of significance to each of the conceptual elements. In short, every concept has a signature—a mapping-–that is unique to each individual. The mapping of all concepts—with their rich tapestries of interconnected information and subjective value–is the Value Topography we mentioned earlier.

### Accessing Concepts – Many Conceptual Triggers

The concept of dog isn't limited to a single label or form of representation. Hearing or reading the word "dog" isn't the only way to trigger the cascade of associated concepts, values, and information. The concept of dog can be represented by images, sounds, scents, textures, movements, colors, shapes, and so on. Any of these things might bring the concept of dog to the periphery of your attention and awareness. You might hear a distant bark, you might feel a furry texture, you might see dog hair on your couch. There are an infinite number of channels by which the concept of dog, and the associated rich cascade of information and subjective value, can enter your mind.

### The Concept Cloud

Every waking moment, you are surrounded by an abundance of conceptual triggers: images, sounds, scents, words, feelings, emotions, desires, fears, threats, interests, ambitions, family, friends, situations, and so on. Concepts are constantly bubbling into and out of the periphery of your conscious perception. On different levels, your brain is absorbing, sorting, evaluating, and prioritizing this information. However, only a small portion of these concepts ever receive the active attention of your cognitive faculties. I refer to the abstract mental space where concepts are constantly bubbling into and out of your perceptual frame as the **Concept Cloud**.

When you focus on a concept, a cascade of correlated concepts, information, and subjective value expands to fill your abstract perceptual frame-–causing unrelated concepts to be minimized and pushed out to the periphery of the Cloud. When you unfocus, concepts ebb and flow in and out of the Cloud based on stresses you might be feeling, anything you or others might be doing, thinking, feeling, saying, or on whatever else might be happening in your immediate surroundings. This conceptual flow, whether focused on or not, is the stream of thought or awareness that is central to our conscious experience.

### Concept Tunneling

With the rise of generative AI there is an art form that has gained in popularity that some refer to as "infinite zoom". This is where you start with a high-level image and as you zoom into it you realize there's far more information and detail to explore. The high-level image might be a crowd of people for instance, and as you zoom into one of the individual's eyeballs, you discover a vast world therein. You can then continue to zoom into any aspect of that hidden world, and find deeper and deeper hidden worlds. You can think of this as "tunneling" and it is a useful metaphor for how we navigate concepts.

As we mentioned previously, when we focus on a concept a cascade of constituent concepts, information, and value fill our perceptual frame. We can subsequently focus on any one of these constituent concepts and proceed to dive deeper and deeper into the abstraction.

The ability of your mind to tunnel into concepts is directly correlated with your level of understanding and experience with the subject. The more you understand, the more rich and dense the conceptual tapestry will be, and the easier it will be for you to tunnel and navigate. Conversely, if you know very little about a subject, it will be difficult for your mind to tunnel without more information. Consider the curious and inquisitive mind of a 3-year-old. They desire to understand the world, but lack the dense conceptual tapestries that we, as adults, have already developed and take for granted.

### Structured Symbolic Language

Structured symbolic languages (i.e. English) were the great unlock for human consciousness and cognitive control. Structured language gave us the means to define, refine, and formalize concepts into a common framework. This framework gave us full narrative control over the Concept Cloud.

Brains natively understand the concepts of objects, actions, actors, outcomes, emotions, and value as they are essential aspects of perceiving, evaluating, and navigating the world. However, structured language formalized these concepts into words and grammatical structures—giving the brain the ability to "speak" and control the language it natively understood.

Structured language gave us the ability to weave common narratives. It gave us the ability to tunnel deeper and deeper into concepts, and the deeper we tunneled, the more we discovered. We were no longer limited to what we could personally experience or observe. We could now construct new realities, new perspectives. We now had the means to push and explore the boundaries of our collective understanding. We now had the means to effectively communicate with others in a way they could intuitively understand. We now had the power to hack minds.

### The Concept of Self

The most detailed, most tunneled, most defined, most vivid concept is the **Concept of Self**. Your concept of Self includes everything you know, everything you believe, everything you value, everything you've ever experienced. It is the vast, dense, galaxy of You. It includes all of your understanding of the world and your place in it. However, it is more than just your Value Topography, it is how you navigate the world, how you act and react, the things you prioritize, the things you expect, the trade-offs you make, the ideals you strive for.

However, to really understand the Self, you first need to understand archetypes.

## 03 Archetypes

**Structured Concepts, Baseline Expectations**

An **archetype** is an expected representation and configuration of a concept. Archetypes act as baseline expectations to which variations can be compared. Without something to compare against, the brain cannot measure tension or determine value. Our entire understanding of our internal and external worlds is anchored by our archetypes.

Just as with concepts, archetypes can be composed of other archetypes. For example, your archetype (baseline expectation) of a house is composed of archetypes of doors, windows, walls, rooms, and so on. In this way, archetypes anchor our understanding of all of reality.

### Experiential Archetypes

**Experiential archetypes** are models of what we've come to expect based primarily on our first-person experience and history. Experiential archetypes are inherently adaptive, adjusting over time to new information and changing circumstances.

Consider the knives in your kitchen that you typically use for cooking. If you use them regularly, they are likely to be good representations of your experiential archetype for kitchen knives. They may not be ideal, but they are what you are accustomed to and what you subconsciously come to expect. Now imagine a scenario where you are trying to cook in someone else's kitchen and you're using their knives. Assuming "sharpness" is the only criterion being considered, if their knives are duller than your experiential archetype, your brain will automatically conclude that they are bad knives.

It's important to emphasize that your brain considers this judgment, not as an opinion, but as a substantiated truth. The deep conviction you feel in this assessment is the phenomenal experience of knowing. You knew the knife was bad as soon as it underperformed the expectations of your experiential archetype.

### Archetypes Anchor Understanding

Archetypes anchor our understanding of everything around us. We have archetypes of people, objects, actions, ideas, literature, movies, music, art, relationships, beauty, success, laws, customs, and so on.

Our level of understanding is proportional to the number of archetypes that we know and the degree to which we have defined them. Learning is a function of adding or refining archetypes. When it comes to dogs, for example, the average person might have a handful of archetypes to represent the few breeds or sizes of dogs that they are familiar with. However, someone who is an expert might have a unique well-defined archetype for each of the hundreds of distinct dog breeds. With this degree of understanding, the expert will quickly notice deviations from expected traits or behaviors that would go unnoticed by the average person.

### Asymmetric Distribution of Archetypes

In our Value Topographies, archetypes cluster like urban hubs in a vast landscape. Their density, distribution, and sensitivity can vary significantly between individuals. Domains that are important to us will have a high density of archetypes with high sensitivity. Domains that are insignificant or unimportant to us might remain relatively barren-–leaving us blind, indifferent, or insensitive to deviations.

### Archetypes and the Human Body

The human body has 7 trillion nerves and 11 physiological systems (each with dedicated organs, tissues, and cells). These systems and nerves, and the perpetual feedback loops they enable, are constantly engaged in keeping your body working within normal parameters. Put another way, you are composed of a vast and dense network of archetypes that your body is constantly working to preserve and maintain. When the body deviates (negatively) from these archetypes, you experience stress, and when it returns, you experience relief. You might know these physiological processes and tension dynamics as homeostasis or allostasis. As we illustrated earlier with the example of the newborn child, it is through these physiological tension dynamics that our Value Topographies first take shape—and it is their continued influence that dominates our phenomenal experience.

### The Archetype of Self

The **Archetype of Self** is the most dense, the most rich, the most vivid, and the most meticulously defined and refined of all of our archetypes. Everything that is important to us exists as constituent archetypes or ideals of the Archetype of Self—the physiological archetypes of your body and health, the familial archetypes of relationships, spouses, parents, siblings, children, pets, close friends, occupational archetypes, financial archetypes, religious archetypes, affiliations, causes, beliefs, interests, and so on. These are the things we prioritize, the things we are most aware of, the things we are most sensitive to. These are the sources of our greatest stress, our greatest relief, and greatest value. These are the archetypes we defend most readily and most passionately.

### Normative Archetypes

**Normative archetypes** are defined collectively whether explicitly or implicitly. Where experiential archetypes typically reflect what is normal or expected from an individual perspective, normative archetypes tend to reflect what is normal or expected for a group. Normative archetypes allow for common standards, shared values, and mutual understanding.

As humans, a large part of our understanding and perception is informed and influenced, whether directly or indirectly, by normative archetypes that we have adopted from external sources. Whether it's parents, friends, cultures, media, entertainment, literature, religions, universities, governments, and so on—these adopted archetypes have an enormous impact on the tension we feel and how our Value Topographies evolve.

These normative archetypes lead to shared narratives, symbols, virtues, cultures, norms, expectations, ideals, fears, anxieties, goals, and so forth. These commonalities lead to similar tension dynamics which, in turn, lead to common subjective conclusions regarding value and "truth". Within our group identities, we have prevailing notions of what it means to live a "good" life or what it means to be a "good" person-–leading us to naturally trust those who share our archetypes and value assessments, and to distrust those who do not.

### Interplay of Experiential and Normative Archetypes

We regularly compare our experiential archetypes against normative archetypes as a means of determining our relative status or worth compared to groups we identify with. If our experiential archetype (personal norm) is negatively deviated from the normative archetype (group norm), we will feel the same certainty of our relative value as we felt with the dull kitchen knives. This negative assessment creates tension and is likely to motivate actions to align more closely to the group expectation.

If aligning with the normative archetype is important to us, then actions taken to bring our experiential norms closer to the group will feel good. They will feel good because they will relieve the tension that we have internalized. Consequently, the actions taken will be considered "good" or justified. The tension between our experiential archetypes and normative archetypes helps to establish and reinforce the Concept of Self as being a distinct identity.

### Archetypes and Resistance to Change

As we discussed with our physiological archetypes, our bodies have a natural incentive to resist or respond to any negative deviations (stress)-–as this is what keeps us alive. However, this disposition to preserve or defend archetypes goes much deeper and much further. With archetypes being foundational to how we understand the world and our place in it, we have an incentive to defend them because if our archetypes are "wrong" then our values, judgments, and priorities might also be wrong. In addition, archetypes can be composed of archetypes that are composed of archetypes. If a constituent archetype is changed, removed, or threatened, it could threaten the stability of the archetypes on which it is built.

On the other hand, experiential archetypes are constantly evolving. They change as we adapt to new information and circumstances. Your archetype of a "typical day" will change dramatically if you have children. Your archetype of a "good relationship" will change if you have one that pushes you to grow in new ways or to have a new perspective. Your archetype of what "healthy" feels like will change as you get older or experience chronic illness.

It is both the rigidity and the plasticity of archetypes that enables tension to be felt, value to be determined, and Value Topographies to adapt and evolve.

## 04 Outcomes

**Variations and Deviations from Archetypes**

An **outcome** is a variation of, or a deviation from, an archetype at a fixed point in time or at a fixed point in a sequence. Where an archetype is the accustomed or expected model or blueprint, outcomes are the actual lived, observed, or imagined experiences. Outcomes are the experiential basis from which archetypes are established and adjusted.

### Outcomes Have Intrinsic Value

All outcomes have an intrinsic measure of goodness or badness. Generally speaking, outcomes that are equivalent to, or better than, the archetype are good, and outcomes that are worse than the archetype are bad. Consider our earlier example of the newborn child. For her, the outcome of being exposed to a colder, louder, and brighter world was a stressful (negative) deviation from what she was accustomed to in the womb. On the other hand, being wrapped warmly in a blanket and returning to the familiarity of her mother's voice, warmth, and heartbeat was a positive calming outcome. The more outcomes she experiences in this new world, the more her archetypes will adjust and evolve to reflect this new reality.

As we get older, we develop vivid histories of experienced, observed or imagined outcomes. We learn either from first-hand experience, or from watching others, which outcomes should be sought after and which outcomes should be avoided. These sensory and emotionally rich histories refine our expectations (archetypes), clarify our Value Topographies, and give us deep intuitions about how good or how bad future outcomes might be—allowing us to take strategic actions accordingly.

### Experienced Outcomes - Memories

Experienced outcomes are the most vivid, the most complete, the most information dense, the most sensory rich forms of outcomes. Experienced outcomes are also sequentially locked. There is a clear causal timeline connecting an experienced outcome to the actions and outcomes that preceded it. These rich, vivid, sensory histories anchor our lives in the vibrant narratives we call memories. This nexus of first-person experiences establishes and reinforces the Concept of Self as the permanent cohesive narrative in our lives.

Experienced outcomes are also our most reliable and influential source for subjective value discovery. The vivid depth and intensity of first-person tension, stresses, relief, emotions, and sensations produce "undeniable" proof for our brain's subsequent value assessments.

### Observed or Conveyed Outcomes

As influential as our experienced outcomes are, they are rivaled by the sheer volume of observed or conveyed outcomes of others. By observing the actions, outcomes, and emotions of others, we are able to clarify and refine our own expectations as to the goodness or badness of potential outcomes, the effectiveness of particular actions, and the limits of what could be experienced.

### Imagined or Abstracted Outcomes

A key role of cognition is to imagine potential actions and to predict and evaluate potential outcomes. This abstraction process is powerful as it allows the brain to "experience" or feel the value of an outcome, or weigh the impact of a decision, without needing to commit to it. Through abstraction, the brain can feel relief (or added stress) as if it were an actual first-person experience. This ability of the brain is essential for motivation, strategic thinking, and discovery.

Imagined (or abstracted) outcomes are unique in that they are not bound by the causal actions that preceded them. Imagined outcomes can be conceptualized without any consideration for how they will be achieved. Because of this, imagined outcomes are not restricted by what is currently possible or probable. Imagined outcomes can push the boundaries of what is conceivable.

This ability of humans to imagine and evaluate actions and outcomes without the constraints of what is practical or even possible is the basis of humanity's profound creativity, artistic expression, religious conviction, scientific advancement, and so on.

### Boundaries and Limits

As we experience or observe more and more outcomes and take more and more actions, we develop strong intuitions as to the limits of how good or how bad the outcomes we experience can be. The deeper these histories go, the stronger these intuitions become–to the point that our brain is subconsciously convinced of their legitimacy (even if our rational mind disagrees). When we have experiences that violate or surpass these limits, our brain is forced to recalibrate. The resulting cognitive dissonance, the relative lack of experience beyond these limits, and the inherent stress or relief associated with the outcome often produces intense positive emotions (e.g. awe, amazement, elation) or intense negative motions (e.g. panic, terror, dread).

There are several varieties of limits that we develop:

- **Practical (Trade-off) Limits**: These are positive or negative "soft" limits bound by what is feasible or plausible to occur based largely on personal situations and experience. Practical limits take into consideration current realities and trade-offs we are willing or unwilling to make.
- **Possible Limits**: These are positive or negative limits bound only by what we consider to be possible based on known actions or observations. It's possible to win the lottery, it's possible to be struck by lightning. Generally, for an outcome to be considered possible, there must be a causal chain of events that would lead to that outcome, even if those events are currently unlikely or inaccessible.
- **Conceivable Limits**: These are positive or negative limits bound only by the limits of our imagination. These are the limits of our darkest nightmares and most fantastical day-dreams.

### Ideals (and Nadirs)

Strongly correlated with the notion of boundaries and limits is the notion of ideals. Ideals can be experiential (based on personal experience or ideation) or normative (based on external standards or expectations, or observations of individuals or members of a group). The brain's conviction of the qualitative superiority of an ideal over the archetype generates tension. As long as the brain maintains the ideal as an aspiration (rather than an expectation) this tension is experienced as a positive motivational force. As we move closer to the ideal, this tension is relieved. The degree of tension we experience is highly correlated with the degree to which we internalize, hold to, or focus on these ideals.

The opposite of an ideal—what I refer to as a nadir-–is also very impactful, but beyond the scope of our discussion. Nadirs are very negative outcomes that are specifically (and often passionately) avoided. They are often the result of experiential trauma but can also be derived from normative notions of outcomes that should be avoided. If the nadir is deeply held or internalized, it can make any negative deviation towards the nadir more stressful than what might normally be experienced.

## 05 Tension and Stress

**Measuring And Interpreting Tension Dynamics**

### What is Tension?

So far in this discussion we have illustrated the tension that existed (as a value differential) between the dull knife and the knife archetype, the tension that can exist between experiential archetypes and normative archetypes, and the tension that exists between archetypes and ideals. These tensions exist because of the essential conviction the brain has in its subjective assessments and expectations. The stronger we hold to an expectation the more conviction the brain will have in its validity and the more tension there will be with any deviation. The greater the rigidity with which we "know" the expected value of something, the more sensitive or responsive we will be to any deviations.

If there is something that humans have very strong standards and expectations about—or very clear archetypes for—it is the human face. Deviations from these expectations can result in the "uncanny valley phenomenon", the eerie or unsettling feeling that we might experience in response to CGI characters, humanoid robots, or AI generated images that appear almost human, but not quite. Our intuition tells us that there is something "wrong" about their appearance even if we can't directly identify the problem. These deviations from our expectations, and the feelings and intuitions we experience, are the result of tension.

Consider your experience of driving. Unless you have a particular reason to be extremely cautious, you're likely not actively aware of all the nuances of driving a vehicle nor are you obsessively vigilant to your surroundings. In other words, most of your actions and reactions are automatic. With years or decades of driving experience, you likely devote sufficient attention to keep you safely on the road, but are comfortable with dividing your attention with anything else you might be thinking about or listening to. Your deep well of experience has trained your brain with very clear standards and expectations when driving, and as you drive you are rigidly (though subconsciously) maintaining those standards. Any deviations from these expectations, like the slightest drift from the car next to you, will cause you to immediately detect and react to the change. Your brain isn't "processing" the information like a computer, it's reacting—like a taut spider web—to deviations from rigid expectations. Your brain is sensing and reacting instinctively to tension. When you are a passenger, and assuming you trust the driver, you are no longer required to actively hold or defend the driving archetype so you become less sensitive and less responsive to deviations.

One of nature's most hypnotic spectacles is a starling murmuration–where massive swarms of birds seem to dance in unison across the sky appearing as if they were a single organism. The largest murmuration ever recorded happened in 1999 and contained an estimated 6 Million birds. So how is this behavior possible? How can so many birds react so quickly and move so synchronously? A computational view of the mind might suggest that the birds are processing flight information (like a computer) at astonishing speeds. A predictive model of the brain might suggest that the birds are predicting movements before they happen—a sort of collective precognition. On the other hand, a tension-based view of the mind posits that when starlings fly, they hold their models and archetypes at such a high level of rigidity that they become extremely responsive to even the slightest deviations of air pressure, wind speed, movements of other birds, and so on. Their reflexes are not the result of computation or prediction but rather the result of tension.

So tension is a function of both the deviation (value differential) and the rigidity with which the archetype is being actively held or defended.

A good way to think of this dynamic is to think of a guitar string. In order for the string to generate a tone, it must be tightened. The tighter the string, the higher the frequency of the vibration. If the string is slack, it cannot generate a tone. When you pluck a guitar string, the string isn't "computing" the action and then producing a sound. It also isn't "predicting" the plucking and then producing the sound to match the expectations. Instead, the sound/vibration is the near instantaneous direct result of the tension and vibration of the string.

### What is Stress?

Stress is the brain's interpretation of the significance of deviations from archetypes—especially as it relates to the Archetype of Self. As we discussed earlier, the Self is the brain's most detailed, the most nested, the most information dense, and the most defended archetype. Relatively small deviations of deeply nested archetypes within the Self can be focused on and magnified so that they are experienced at the highest level as deviations of the entire Self.

Where tension is a function of the deviation and the rigidity of the archetype, stress is the brain's interpretation—its intuition—of what it means and why it matters. Stress considers factors like direction of the deviation, its momentum, time considerations, action potentials, future predictions of possible outcomes, conviction of preexisting values or judgments, interpretations of the actions and motives of others, and so on.

Imagine something happening that causes your bedroom window to shatter. A broken window is of course a negative deviation of the archetype of your window. It is also a negative deviation of the archetype of your bedroom. It is also a negative deviation of the archetype of your house. And finally, because it is your house, it is a negative deviation of your Archetype of Self. The shattering of your bedroom window can lead to many stressful interpretations and extrapolations: "Was it broken intentionally? Is someone trying to break in?", "How much will it cost to replace? Can I afford it?", "I can't deal with this right now, I've got too much on my plate", "how can I keep bugs from coming in?", "Am I going to freeze? it's cold outside", and so on. On the other hand, if it's your neighbor's window that breaks, you are unlikely to experience anywhere near the same level of tension or stress as it doesn't represent a deviation in, or a threat to, your Archetype of Self.

Returning to the driving example: tension enables your responsiveness to deviations, while stress is your interpretation of the significance of the deviations. When the driver next to you moves in an unexpected way, your brain reacts to the tension, but also interprets the actions, the motives, and the possible threat that the driver's actions represent. Your intuitions and interpretations of the situation result in the measure of stress that you feel.

Stress draws from our deep intuitions (refined by experience and observation) regarding what certain outcomes mean, what actions are likely to follow. These intuitions or interpretations are infused with the same subjective certainty with which brains hold other values, archetypes, limits, and so forth. Stress, therefore, is an expression of conviction regarding the relative degree of badness of an outcome, an action, an actor, and so on.

### Types of Stress

As alluded to above, there are many ways the brain can interpret the impact of tension dynamics and there are many factors that the brain considers (momentum, direction, available actions, potential outcomes, etc). However, for our discussion we will highlight four broad categories of stress:

- **Acute Stress**: Strong intuitions about the significance of the actual deviation of a Now State (the current outcome) from an archetype. If you are hungry, for example, acute stress is your brain's interpretation of the magnitude and significance of that hunger. Two people can be physiologically experiencing the same caloric deficit—the same degree of deviation from satiation—but the acute stress they experience might vary significantly.
- **Fear**: Strong intuitions about potential losses or future negative deviations from the Now State or an archetype based on current interpretations of recent actions, actors, motives, availability of remedies, degree of preparation and experience, etc. Continuing with the hunger example, someone who is hungry but has no money or no prospects for their next meal is likely to experience significantly higher levels of correlated stress (acute stress + fear) than someone who is equally hungry but whose next meal is assured.
- **Loss**: Strong intuitions and cognitive dissonance regarding the loss of something or someone that the brain "knows" is valuable, or the loss of access to previously accessible positive outcomes. For example, when I lost my father the moments where I struggled most were when I realized he wouldn't be there to meet the woman I married, he wouldn't be there to meet any future grandchildren. Loss can feel like a "blackout" of precious real estate on our Value Topographies. The resulting emptiness creates an imbalance that forces a recalibration of our archetypes.
- **Eustress (Hidden Stress)**: Strong positive intuitions and interpretations regarding the state of deviation from a positive goal or ideal. I consider eustress to be "hidden" in the sense that (unlike Acute Stress, Fear, and Loss) it doesn't register as a negative quantity. Examples of eustress would be the motivating force behind curiosity or the feeling of excitement (rather than dread) at a big challenge in your way. Eustress is the simultaneous conviction that a goal is worthwhile and that you are specifically qualified or positioned to achieve it. Where relief of negative stress can feel calming or reassuring, relief of eustress can feel validating or invigorating.

### How Stress (and Tension) Distort the Value Topography

The Value Topography is the vast, ever-evolving landscape of our subjective assessments. It operates as a thick lens or heat map that illuminates the significance-–the level of goodness or badness-–of everything in our internal (thoughts and abstractions) and external environments. Scaffolding this Topography are our standards and expectations (i.e. archetypes, ideals). When we experience and interpret deviations from our standards (tension and stress) the Topography becomes distorted. The perceived value of things that might relieve (or worsen) the stress and tension are intensified. The more intense the stress, the more warped the distortion. The more immediate or acute the stress, the more violent the distortion.

Consider the dramatic difference in how you perceive the value of a glass of water when you have been out in the hot sun and are severely dehydrated. Consider how good a comfortable chair looks when your back and legs hurt from being on your feet all day. Consider the desire to shrink or disappear when you embarrass yourself. Consider how immediately your priorities shift when someone close to you has an emergency.

### Patterns in the Warping

It's important to note that it isn't just that the Topography is warping, but that with experience, the tension, the stress, and the warpings themselves become familiar and predictable patterns to the brain. The more familiar our brains are with certain patterns of tension and stress, the more they desire certain patterns for relief—and the more ardently and intuitively they will avoid patterns, actions, or outcomes that will make the stress worse.

### Multidimensionality of Tension and Stress

We often think of hunger as a single homeostatic dimension, and that the only thing that changes is the degree or level of our hunger. However, this is a gross oversimplification of a much more rich and dynamic process. Your body needs six essential nutrient classes—carbs, fats, protein, vitamins, minerals, and water—with over 40 specific compounds crucial for growth, energy, and cell function. When you experience "hunger", you aren't simply experiencing the tension and stress of a caloric deficit-–but rather the combined tensions and stresses of a very specific cocktail of acute deficiencies. This cocktail warps and distorts your Value Topography such that you crave certain foods over others.

If deviations from a small multiple of nutritional or physiological archetypes can create such varieties of distortion patterns (distinct cravings), imagine the limitless varieties of patterns happening across your entire archetype superstructure at any given moment. Patterns of physiological tension and stress, psychological tension and stress, emotional tension and stress, social tension and stress, financial tension and stress, and so on. Consider how these constantly changing patterns impact your attention, priorities, desires, and motivations.

### Relieving Tension and Stress

I am not a psychologist, but my limited understanding of at least one of the symptoms of OCD is the intense need for things to be perfectly aligned, symmetrical, or arranged in a specific way—with any deviation causing severe tension and stress (anxiety). My interpretation of this symptom is: 1) the person with OCD is holding and defending an archetype in a very rigid state (like a driver) and can't relax (like a passenger), and 2) that the individual's brain lacks sufficient strategies for resolving the high degree of tension and stress it experiences from deviations from its expectations.

Relieving tension is a function of either resolving the differential (closing the gap), or relaxing the rigidity with which you hold the standard or expectation. There are three essential ways to "close the gap": 1) adjust the deviation so that it aligns more closely to the standard or expectation (this appears to be the primary OCD strategy), 2) adjust the standard or expectation to be closer in line with the deviation (this is how we adapt or cope with new circumstances), or 3) identify a new standard, classification, or archetype to account for the deviation (this is how we refine the tapestry of our understanding).

Ultimately, however, the most effective way-–the most direct way-–to relieve tension and stress is through actions…

## 06 Actions

**Mitigating and Modulating Stress and Tension**

Actions—whether taken by the entity, other actors, or dynamic environments—are the means by which outcomes are achieved and the primary mechanism by which tension and stress are modulated. Actions are the means by which the Value Topography is navigated and how distortions both arise and are resolved.

However, actions don't exist in isolation. Every action has trade-offs or residual consequences. An action that resolves stress/tension for one archetype or distortion might unintentionally or unavoidably increase stress/tension for countless others. This constant push and pull on our Topographies is the phenomenal "dance" of life.

### Actions as Concepts and Archetypes

Concepts, as mentioned earlier, are rich nested galaxies of correlated information, subjectivity, and other nested concepts. To the brain, everything is a concept—including actions. Every action draws from a rich history of experience, observation, imagination, sensory information, subjective value, and so on. Every action has conceptual structure and is anchored in expectations that have been defined and refined by their effectiveness at resolving distortions in the Value Topography.

Every action you take is scaffolded by experiential (or normative) archetypes. Actions that underperform the archetype are automatically considered "bad" by the brain. Actions that meet or exceed the archetype are automatically considered "good" by the brain. The degree of tension with which an archetype is held will increase the sensitivity of these deviations, and the interpretations and significance of the deviations are the measures of stress and distortion you feel.

### Evaluation By Association

The value of an action-–its "goodness" or "badness"---can be inherited by, or attributed to, the actor (the sentient agent, or a non-sentient element of a dynamic environment) as well as any objects, resources, ideas, and so forth that contributed significantly to the action. If the action provides net relief—if it resolves distortion in the Topography-–then the actor and/or object is deemed good. If the action increases net stress-–if it intensifies the distortion-–the actor and/or object is deemed bad.

Subjective valuations derived from experiential stress and relief are considered "facts" to the brain. So what happens when two "facts" contradict? What happens when a bad actor performs a good action? Or a good actor performs a bad action? The brain is constantly faced with nuanced dissonance from seemingly contradictory evaluations. The interplay and conflict of what the brain holds to be true is the basis of our emotions.

### Reactions, Impulses, Reflexes

The more expert you are at an action, the more refined and defined the archetype—and the more rigidly you will hold that archetype. The increased tension, the increased conviction in your archetype, will make you more sensitive to even the slightest deviations. The actions become easy, automatic, reflexive. The actions become inextricable from the patterns of tension/stress that they resolve, such that the pattern of distortion will immediately elicit the action. This is how we are able to act on "autopilot".

When we are acting automatically or reflexively, we're not processing like a computer, nor are we predicting-–instead, our actions are bound to the very contours and distortions of the Topography itself. The actions we take feel natural, obvious, and effortless—so much so that it would take effort to act in any other way.

### Strategic Actions of Advanced Cognition

Often, however, it is essential to choose actions deliberately–-to act against the impulses and reflexes-–so that more effective actions can be learned or explored, or so that tension and stress can be relieved holistically rather than myopically. This is the evolutionary pressure for advanced cognition. Cognition grants us the ability to act strategically, to weigh trade-offs, and to predict and imagine possible outcomes. It allows us to draw from our rich histories and rigid mappings of subjective "truths" to evaluate potential choices not just logically, but intuitively-–to imagine and to feel (to "know") the potential holistic impact on the Topography without having to commit to the action.

### Intuition

Intuition is a deep "knowing" (refined by experience) of the current or potential impact of an action on stress, tension, warpings, and distortions–beyond our active perception or awareness. It is our ability to consider, to feel (in the present), the patterns of shifting tension dynamics that could result from an action. The net valence and intensity of these patterns is the "gut feeling" we experience.

Intuition is our ability to feel the value of an outcome as if we are experiencing it. The power of abstraction (imagination) and intuition (ability to feel potential changes to the Topography) is why day-dreaming can feel so cathartic, or why we can feel emotions (e.g. excitement, dread, embarrassment) for actions we've never taken or outcomes we've never achieved.

### Actions in the Brain

To the brain, there is very little difference between a physical action (an action that takes place in the external world) and an action that takes place entirely in the mind. The foundational mechanism is the same, the tension dynamics are the same, the power to warp, distort, or relieve the Topography is the same.

Thinking is the ability to visualize, contextualize, and reframe. Often the best way to relieve stress or tension is to simply consider and evaluate different perspectives—to actively modulate or reframe the very assumptions on which the tension and stress are based.

### Words and Thoughts

Words (i.e. concepts, thoughts) are actions. They can create tension, stress, and relief. They can warp and distort the Value Topography. They can form distinctive and familiar patterns. The tension with which we hold our archetypes of structured language allows us to navigate conversations with as much agility as swarms of starlings dancing across the sky. We effortlessly modulate our tone, speed, rhythm, emphasis, and the cadence of our speech. Communication can feel so effortless and natural that it often feels like we're being pulled more by gravity than being pushed by some computational exertion. We can also use words expertly and strategically to hack our own minds or the minds of others.

Structured language and thoughts allow us to seize complete control of the Concept Cloud. They allow us to recursively tunnel and explore the dense tapestries-–the endless cascade—of nested concepts. Guided by our intuitions, experiences, and judgments, and the tension with which we hold our archetypes—especially our Archetype of Self—we can zero in on any distortions, imagine and evaluate potential solutions, and develop strategic plans of action.

### Other "Languages" of Stress

The ability to "hack" the tension dynamics of the brain is not limited to structured symbolic languages (i.e. English). Humans have developed, or tapped into, other modalities for expressing and modulating tension dynamics-–other "languages" of stress with the power to hack our minds, modulate our tensions, distort our Topographies, convey narrative, and elicit emotions, such as: Music, Dance, Painting, Sculpture, Film, and so on.

About a year ago I had the chance to visit Europe for the first time. It was enchanting. There was so much to see, so much rich history. However, the standout moment for me was in Vienna where we attended a Catholic Mass in an incredible cathedral. I am not Catholic, however I cannot remember a time when I was as moved by music as I was on that day. The beauty, the resonance, the power, the perfection of a chorus of trained voices filling the room with exquisite grandeur. I could read a million words and not experience the same proximity with the divine as that moment. The power of music to "speak" the language of stress is incredible.

However, there is one form of expression that is completely native to the brain, something primal, something as fundamental as the mechanics of tension, stress, and relief themselves…
